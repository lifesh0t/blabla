Here you can find and tic tac toe game code. Game is clear for everybody if not i can remmind you:

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple and classic game that can be played by two players. The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid. Here are the basic rules:
1. Game Setup:
The game board is a 3x3 grid, which can be drawn on paper or represented digitally.
There are two players, one is designated as "X" and the other as "O."

2. Objective:
The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of your marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal.

3. Gameplay:
Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty square on the grid.
"X" typically goes first, although this can be decided differently if agreed upon by both players.

4. Winning the Game:
A player wins by placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. There are eight possible ways to win:
Three horizontal rows:
Top row: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)
Middle row: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)
Bottom row: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)
Three vertical columns:
Left column: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1)
Middle column: (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)
Right column: (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)
Two diagonals:
Diagonal from top left to bottom right: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
Diagonal from top right to bottom left: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

5. Draw/Tie:
If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw or tie.

6. Restarting the Game:
After a game is won or drawn, players can reset the board and start a new game if they wish to continue playing.

7. Strategy Tips:
Try to control the center of the board, as it offers the most opportunities to create a winning line.
Pay attention to your opponentâ€™s moves and block them if they are about to win.
Look for opportunities to create a situation where you have two potential ways to win, forcing your opponent to block only one.
This game is a great way to practice basic strategic thinking and can be enjoyed by players of all ages!
